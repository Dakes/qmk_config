# kyria

For Modular Bongo Cat look in my [userspace](userspace/dakes/)  

My Kyria keymaps:  

[Dakes](kyria/keymaps/dakes)  (The one I use)  
[Neo](kyria/keymaps/dakes_neo): As true to the original Neo layout as possible. Includes all Greek and Math symbold on Lyers 5&6.  
[NeoQwertz](kyria/keymaps/dakes_neoqwertz): All advantages of Neo with the qwertz layout.
